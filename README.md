#### ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER: Eventhough I don't think it is likely, WeMod could in theory ban you for this. I take no responsibilty for any damage caused by the usage of this program.

<br/>

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
There's one thing you can install:
- [A CLI](cli/README.md)

COMING SOON (done but I'm not able to package it): [A GUI desktop application (recommended when done)](gui/README.md)

<br/>

## ‚ùå What does not work?
- RC From Phone (this feature is not client-side so you actually need pro; there's nothing I can do)

<br/>

## üîí Is it safe?
This program may sound like malware at first, but if you're unsure, just read the source code. It's quite small and (hopefully, I'm relatively new to Rust) readable.

<br/>

## ‚ùì It stopped working after the latest update, what should I do?
This is probably because WeMod updated itself and now uses a new directory. To fix this, just run the program again.
