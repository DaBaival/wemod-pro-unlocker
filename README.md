## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER: Eventhough I don't think it is likely, WeMod could in theory ban you for this. I take no responsibilty for any damage caused by the usage of this program.

<br/>

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
#### Note: after following any of the steps below, you must restart WeMod (make sure to also close it from the tray)
For installation, you have three options.
1. Download a build from the releases tab
2. Install Cargo, then run
```
cargo install wemod-pro-unlocker
wemod-pro-unlocker
```
3. (Not recommended) Manually build it from source

<br/>

## üîí Is it safe?
This program may sound like maleware at first, but if you're unsure, just read the source code. It's quite small and (hopefully, I'm relatively new to Rust) readable.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
| Argument                  	| Description                                                                                                 	| Example
|---------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------
| --wemod-dir <dir>         	| Path to your WeMod dir. By default, this is "%localappdata%/WeMod".                                         	| C:\WeMod
| --wemod-version <version> 	| The version to patch. By default, this will be the latest version installed. 	                                | 8.3.6
| --asar-bin <bin>          	| Path to the asar bin. By default, this will be "Program Files/nodejs/asar.cmd".                             	| C:\asar\asar.cmd
| -dev                      	| When used, WeMod will be patched to enable dev mode when opening it with "-dev".                             	| -----
| --account <json>            | Overwrites the account data. You can find all available options by searching for /v3/account in the dev tools | username:'myaccount',email:'test'

<br/>

## ‚ùì It stopped working after the latest update, what should I do?
This is probably because WeMod updated itself and now uses a new directory. To fix this, just run the program again.

##### Hint: You can create a shortcut which always launches both the unlocker and WeMod to automatically patch WeMod after updates.
